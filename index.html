            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I'm a Canadian high school student interested in computer science, engineering, and related concepts. I enjoy building things and programming.</p> <p>From January to April 2024, I was working as a student researcher and software engineering intern at the University of Waterloo. During this internship, I gained experience building a GUI for a terminal-based software security project. In addition, I produced a demo that was presented at <a href="https://conf.researchr.org/home/icse-2024">the International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE) 2024</a>. Prior to that, I was a backend engineer intern at American Inn Ozark, where I worked closely with staff to build <a href="https://www.americaninnozark.com">their beta-stage website</a>, as well as a customizable real-time notification system to inform hotel management about new reservations (this was my innovation).</p>
            <p>In my free time, you will find me developing software, creating new technologies, participating in competitive programming competitions, doing math, listening to classical music, or reading. I also enjoy playing tennis and squash! My skillset includes C/C++, Python, Java, web development, SQL, Git, Docker, and Linux. For more information, please view my <a href="/resume">résumé</a>.</p>
